% Copied from http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/43008/absolute-value-symbols
% These lines will create an absolute value and normalize display function

\DeclarePairedDelimiter\abs{\lvert}{\rvert}%
\DeclarePairedDelimiter\norm{\lVert}{\rVert}%

% Swap the definition of \abs* and \norm*, so that \abs
% and \norm resizes the size of the brackets, and the 
% starred version does not.

% This will create a new figure environment for circuits (caption starts with Circuit, different table, etc)
\DeclareFloatingEnvironment{schematic}

% This will create a new command to negate a logic variable
